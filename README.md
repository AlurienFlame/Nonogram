#### Win Condition

Win by using `left click` to select every cell containing a hidden blue objective.

#### Loss Condition

You will lose the game if you get three red strikes. You get strikes by selecting cells that _do not_ contain blue objectives.

#### Marking

Use `right click` to mark cells in green. This has no effect on gameplay, but can be essential for remembering which cells do not contain blue objectives. Think of marks like flags in minesweeper.

#### Numbers

The numbers along the side and top of the game indicate how many objectives are adjacent to each other in a column or row. Dashes indicate gaps of any length between groups of objectives.

For example, a row labled `3-1` in a five cell wide board would indicate the following pattern:
( )( )( ){ }( )
